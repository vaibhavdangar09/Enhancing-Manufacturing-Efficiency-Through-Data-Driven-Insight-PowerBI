# Background
You are a data analyst at ProManu Analytics, a consultancy firm specializing in manufacturing analytics. Your team has been provided with two datasets: 'Manufacturing Production Data' and 'Employee Performance Metrics'. The 'Manufacturing Production Data' dataset encapsulates detailed information about various products, including production dates, costs, quantities, and warehouse locations. The 'Employee Performance Metrics' dataset offers insights into the workforce, covering departments, salaries, performance ratings, and countries of operation.

In a manufacturing landscape where efficiency, cost management, and employee performance are intricately linked, your analytical expertise is essential. Your challenge is to explore these datasets to identify trends and insights that could streamline manufacturing processes, optimize resource allocation, and enhance employee productivity.

# Objective
Your objective is to utilize Power BI to analyze and interpret these manufacturing datasets, crafting a story that reveals underlying trends and operational insights. This task involves meticulous data cleansing, robust data modeling, and the strategic application of DAX for sophisticated analytics. The end goal is to develop an interactive, user-friendly dashboard in Power BI, presenting a coherent narrative that highlights key insights. This includes understanding the relationship between production costs and output, analyzing employee performance across different departments and locations, and recommending strategies for improving manufacturing efficiency and workforce productivity. Your analysis will not only inform ProManu Analytics' consultancy services but also provide actionable guidance to manufacturing firms striving to excel in a competitive market.
